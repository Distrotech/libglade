    <para>Libglade offers an alternative to Glade's code generation
    features.  Instead of producing code that when compiled will
    display your interface, libglade parses the XML description of the
    interface at runtime.  This way, it is possible for the user or
    developer to modify the interface without having to recompile the
    program.</para>

    <para>Libglade supports all standard GTK widgets that Glade does,
    and is written in such a way that this could be extended to all
    GNOME widgets at a later point in time.  I have not written code
    to display these widgets yet, since Glade does not support them
    (libglade would loose its usefulness if it expected input in a
    different form to the output of Glade).</para>
