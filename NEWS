libglade-0.4:  24-August-1999
	- Use gdk_keyval_by_name instead of a local hash table for looking
	  up key values for accelerators.  This removes a big hash table
	  from libglade's overhead.
	- Radio buttons groups are really fixed this time.
	- Table column spacing is correctly interpreted now.
	- Support for the GtkPacker widget has been added.

libglade-0.3:  9-August-1999
	- Changed over to a SAX based XML parser.  This cuts down on memory
	  usage and increases speed a bit for the parser.  It also reduces
	  the number of malloc's and frees.
	- Better handling of accelerator keys, including underline accelerators
	  for menu items and buttons.
	- Miscelaneous bug fixes.

libglade-0.2:  20-June-1999
	- Radio group support
	- The start of gnome support -- this code has been split off into a
	  separate library called libglade-gnome.  You can get the cflags or
	  libraries to link with the gnome code by calling `libglade-config
	  --cflags --libs gnome`.  Also, if you want gnome support, you
	  should call glade_gnome_init() instead of glade_init().
	- I18N support.  Libglade can either use the current translation
	  domain when building the widget tree, or you can specify a
	  different one with glade_xml_new_with_domain().  There is also
	  a program called libglade-xgettext to help extract strings for
	  translation from an XML file.

libglade-0.1: 27-May-1999
	- Many fixes from many people.  This version should actually be
	  useable.
	- Now includes documentation.

libglade-0.0.3: 2-November-1998
	- Forgot to include makekeys.awk -- this may have caused problems
	  for some people.

libglade-0.0.2: 1-November-1998
	- Updated to work with the changes Daniel made to libxml.
	- Added support for keyboard accelerators.

libglade-0.0.1: 25-October-1998
	- Initial release
