libglade-0.2:
	- Radio group support
	- The start of gnome support -- this code has been split off into a
	  separate library called libglade-gnome.  You can get the cflags or
	  libraries to link with the gnome code by calling `libglade-config
	  --cflags --libs gnome`.  Also, if you want gnome support, you
	  should call glade_gnome_init() instead of glade_init().
	- I18N support.  Libglade can either use the current translation
	  domain when building the widget tree, or you can specify a
	  different one with glade_xml_new_with_domain().  There is also
	  a program called libglade-xgettext to help extract strings for
	  translation from an XML file.
