libglade-0.6:  20-September-1999
	- libglade now honours the has_focus and has_default flags for
	  widgets.
	- The correct default for can_focus (false) is now used.  This was
	  found by Miguel.  It should prevent the segfaults caused by
	  infinite recursion some people were seeing.
	- Placeholders are removed from the interface as it gets parsed.  The
	  warnings were not really very useful, and there are times when you
	  want to leave some spaces blank (such as in tables).
	- Fixed bug with setting accelerators that have no modifiers.  This
	  one was found by Paul Clifford.

libglade-0.5:  7-September-1999
	- removed some stuff to do with glade-keys.c I missed in the last
	  release.
	- If a .glade file has been changed on disk since it was last loaded
	  by libglade, it is reparsed.  This should be helpful for libptb.
	- New function glade_xml_new_from_memory for building an interface
	  from an in memory buffer containing the XML file.
	- Better support for underline accelerators.  You can now set
	  underline accelerators on GtkLabel's, and get them to change focus
	  to another widget, click a button, or change the page on a notebook.
	- Added support for the GtkLayout, GnomeIconList, GnomeIconSelection,
	  GnomeDruid, GnomeDruidPageStart, GnomeDruidPageFinish,
	  GnomeDruidPageStandard, GnomePixmap and GnomePropertyBox widgets.

libglade-0.4:  24-August-1999
	- Use gdk_keyval_by_name instead of a local hash table for looking
	  up key values for accelerators.  This removes a big hash table
	  from libglade's overhead.
	- Radio buttons groups are really fixed this time.
	- Table column spacing is correctly interpreted now.
	- Support for the GtkPacker widget has been added.

libglade-0.3:  9-August-1999
	- Changed over to a SAX based XML parser.  This cuts down on memory
	  usage and increases speed a bit for the parser.  It also reduces
	  the number of malloc's and frees.
	- Better handling of accelerator keys, including underline accelerators
	  for menu items and buttons.
	- Miscelaneous bug fixes.

libglade-0.2:  20-June-1999
	- Radio group support
	- The start of gnome support -- this code has been split off into a
	  separate library called libglade-gnome.  You can get the cflags or
	  libraries to link with the gnome code by calling `libglade-config
	  --cflags --libs gnome`.  Also, if you want gnome support, you
	  should call glade_gnome_init() instead of glade_init().
	- I18N support.  Libglade can either use the current translation
	  domain when building the widget tree, or you can specify a
	  different one with glade_xml_new_with_domain().  There is also
	  a program called libglade-xgettext to help extract strings for
	  translation from an XML file.

libglade-0.1: 27-May-1999
	- Many fixes from many people.  This version should actually be
	  useable.
	- Now includes documentation.

libglade-0.0.3: 2-November-1998
	- Forgot to include makekeys.awk -- this may have caused problems
	  for some people.

libglade-0.0.2: 1-November-1998
	- Updated to work with the changes Daniel made to libxml.
	- Added support for keyboard accelerators.

libglade-0.0.1: 25-October-1998
	- Initial release
