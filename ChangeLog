	* test-libglade.c (main): Add GNOME support.  Use
	gnome_init_with_popt_table here.  Use argument parsing the popt
	way. 

	* Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.am: Setup for dual GTK+/GNOME
	compilation. 
	
	* glade/glade-gtk.c (button_stock_new): Add support for GNOME
	stock labels.

	* configure.in (have_gnome): Add autodetection for GNOME
	components. 

1999-04-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* test-libglade.c (main): argument parsing code wasn't recognising
	the rootnode argument.  This batch of fixes was sent in by Philippe
	Giacinti (I am still reviewing the local style part of the patch).

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_get_type): wasn't saving the object
	type correctly.  Caused problems if more than one GladeXML object
	was created.
	(glade_xml_build_widget): in newer versions of GLADE, it uses the
	signal tag instead of Signal, and accelerator instead of Accelerator.
	Now libglade recognises the new tags as having the same meaning.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: some small changes for the box and dialog child
	adding routines (I had GTK_PACK_START where it should have been
	"GTK_PACK_START").

1999-04-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* configure.in: bumped required version of GTK up to 1.2.0.

	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-private.h: changed some occurences
	of "char *" to "const char *" to remove warnings made by Miguel's
	change.

1999-04-20  Erik Walthinsen  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* added libglade-config.in, changed Makefile.am and configure.in
	to match and create libglade-config, added to spec file.

1999-04-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-xml.h: Tag return values as "const char *" to warn
	the user not to free the results of these.

1999-04-06  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: a few small fixes to make libglade compile
	correctly with newer versions of GTK.

1999-01-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* autogen.sh: it wasn't calling autoheader, which caused some trouble.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: some small changes to make it compile with newer
	versions of gtk.  Also made the function call changes found in
	gtkcompat.h

	* glade/glade-xml.c: gtk_container_border_width -> set_border_width.

1998-11-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-styles.c: changed to recognise new style tags.  Basically
	occurences of "fg:" have been changed to "fg-", and similar for other
	parts of the style code.

1998-11-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* autogen.sh: added a simple autogen shell script to help with CVS
	builds.

1998-11-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* everything: added copyright messages to the code.

1998-11-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/Makefile.am, configure.in: I forgot to include the makekeys.awk
	file in the distribution.  This may have caused problems for some
	people.

1998-11-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* configure.in: added option --enable-debug.  This will turn on
	debugging output, which is what has been the default in the previous
	version.  Without this flag, the library is quiet, except for errors.
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/makekeys.awk: added support for keyboard
	accelerators.  Makekeys.awk creates glade-keys.c, which handles
	keysym to int conversion.  If no accelerators are used in the UI
	description, this adds no overhead.  If there are accelerators, there
	will be a hash table initialisation, and a hash table lookup for each
	accelerator.

1998-10-31  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-gtk.c: made changes so that libglade
	works correctly with the changes Daniel made to libxml.  Note that
	since xmlNodeGetContent doesn't use g_malloc, free is used instead
	of g_free.
	Also, no strings inside the xmlDoc structure are referenced in the
	GladeXML widget, so it should be possible to free the xmlDoc
	structure without problems.

1998-10-25  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-gtk.c: updated for glade-0.3.5 widgets.  It now supports
	menus.  I also fixed up the dialog child packing function.
	* test.glade, simple.glade, example.glade: added some examples.
	* glade/glade-init.c: added interface to extend libglade's list of
	widgets dynamically.  Maybe this could be used so that interfaces
	are listed in the XML, and loaded on call.
	* libglade.spec: a spec file for this package.

1998-10-23  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-gtk.c: new file -- this holds all the widget specific
	code for all the widgets in glade-0.3.3.
	* test-libglade.c: new file -- a tester program that can load
	arbitrary interface files.  I can actually get most interfaces to
	load without problem now.
	* glade/glade-xml.c: added support for automatic connection of signals
	with gmodule (you can get access to the global namespace with
	g_module_open(NULL, 0)).

1998-10-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-init.c: new file -- initialisation of libglade.
	* glade/glade-tree.c: new file -- handles reading in and caching of
	XML descriptions.  It also extracts the widget tree, and gets the
	styles parsed.
	* glade/glade-styles.c: new file -- Parses styles from an XML tree
	by translating them to the same format as gtkrc files and passing
	them to gtk_rc_parse_string.
	* glade/glade-xml.c: new file -- This file is the exposed interface
	to libglade, and has code used to glue in widget sets to libglade.
